    <h4><strong>Marco Rubio</strong></h4>
    <p>The lives of Marco’s parents were forever changed in 1956 when they came to America from Cuba. Early on, Mario and Oria Rubio struggled being in the United States and wondered whether they had made the right decision. But in the decades that followed, America proved to be that shining city on the hill as they worked their way into the middle class and were able to provide opportunities for their children that had previously been out of reach.</p>
    <p>Rubio’s parents came from a place where this would have never been possible. In Cuba, they were not born into the right privilege that so few in that country enjoyed. But in the United States, their story became part of the historic tale we all know as the American Dream.</p>
    <p>Growing up in West Miami and Las Vegas, Marco saw all of this develop from an early age. He saw that hard work and sacrifice led to achievement. He knew, firsthand, what his parents did to succeed. He watched his mother, Oria, work as a maid, cashier and stock clerk. He saw his father, Mario, work as a bartender, only to come home from work so late at night.</p>
    <p>Above all, he saw how their hard work transformed his family and he knew that in America, anything was possible.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, too many of our people doubt whether these stories of hard work and opportunity can still be possible in America. The grand idea of the American Dream is in peril. Washington politicians, in both parties, have spent decades borrowing and spending the U.S. into an $18 trillion debt. They refuse to modernize our economy and government institutions to reflect a changing world. All of this has created deep skepticism while people struggle to keep up with the rising cost of living.</p>
    <p>As a U.S. Senator, Marco has led a bold offensive to institute innovative, conservative ideas to address these fundamental issues and to restore hope in the American Dream. His ideas are firmly rooted in this simple truth – the American economy has changed significantly in recent decades and our policies must change with it. He has proposed conservative reforms to our nation’s anti-poverty laws, tax code, regulatory policies, higher education system, vital senior safety net programs and national defense.</p>
    <p>All of these efforts are aimed squarely at one thing – restoring the hope and promise that the American Dream is real and that every American can achieve their own unique version of that dream. He believes that with a smart, limited government approach, Americans can work together to revive the founding principles that made this country great. He wants to bring it into reach of more people than ever before, and usher in a New American Century even more brilliant and prosperous than the last.</p>
    <p>What drives Marco to do this?</p>
    <p>For starters, he believes that America does not owe him. Rather, he believes that he owes America for the opportunities that this country has given him and his family.</p>
    <p>He believes that this great nation has provided so much. The chance to graduate from the University of Florida and then the University of Miami’s law school. The chance to marry his wife Jeanette in 1998, with whom he is raising four children: Amanda, Daniella, Anthony and Dominick. And the chance for both of them to give back through public service as a West Miami city commissioner; a Florida state legislator that rose to become majority whip, majority leader and speaker of the house; and since 2011, as a U.S. Senator. For all the opportunities this country has provided Marco and his family, including all that Jeanette has accomplished through her charitable work, he is indebted to this great country.</p>
    <p>Across America today, too many people are wondering if the American Dream is still possible. Marco Rubio has no doubt that it is. But make no mistake: it will require new leadership and a bold conservative reform agenda built for the 21st century.</p>
    <p>Join Marco today to reclaim the American Dream and make sure this century becomes a New American Century.</p>
